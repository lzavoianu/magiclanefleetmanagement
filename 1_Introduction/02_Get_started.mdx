This section will guide you on how to interact with the **Fleet Management RestAPI** by explaining what an API request is, how to include an API key, and what a request looks like.

## What is an API Request?

An API request is how you interact with the Fleet Management API. It's a structured HTTP message that allows your application to retrieve or send data to the server. Each request typically consists of:

- **Endpoint URL**: The specific address of the resource you are interacting with, such as `/customers` or `/vehicles`.
- **HTTP Method**: The action you want to perform (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Headers**: Information like your API key for authentication and content types.
- **Request Body (for POST/PUT)**: Data sent to the API in JSON format.

## How to Use an API Key

The Fleet Management API requires an API key to authenticate requests. Without it, the server will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` error. The API key is sent in the request headers as follows:

- **Header Name**: `Authorization`
- **Header Value**: `<Your_API_Key>`

## Example Request with API Key

Here's a simple example of a request to retrieve all customers:

### Request Details:

- **Endpoint**: `https://fleetmanagement.magiclaneapis.com/v1/customers`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: <Your_API_Key>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`

### Request Example (cURL):

```sh
curl -X GET "https://fleetmanagement.magiclaneapis.com/v1/customers" \
-H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  
```

## Authentication with API Key

Every Magic Lane SDK instance requires a unique API Key for authentication. Here's how to create an account, generate an API key, and integrate it into your requests.

:::danger[Warning]
Ensure that the API key remains secure and is not exposed. If the key is compromised or its integrity is uncertain, promptly revoke it and generate a new one to maintain security and prevent unauthorized usage that may incur additional costs.

## Create an API Key

The project is created with an API key with a short expiration date.
![Project API Keys image](_images/project-api-keys.png "Project API Keys")

Click `Generate additional API Key` to create another key for your project, where you can set an expiration date further into the future.

![Generate API Key modal image](_images/generate-api-key-modal.png "Generate API Key modal")

You can give the new API key a different name, and set any expiration date you want.
Click `Generate` to generate the API key.

:::danger[Warning]
Ensure that key management is properly planned and that the key on the clientâ€™s device is updated before its expiration date. Failure to do so will result in a watermark being displayed on the map and certain features becoming limited once the key has expired.
