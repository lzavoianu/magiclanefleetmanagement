# Configuration Parameters  


<ReadingTime/>
<br/>

## Overview  
`Configuration Parameters` class in RestAPI define key settings that influence the behavior of the route optimization process. These settings determine aspects such as optimization goals, search time limits, and flexibility in handling orders. Proper configuration ensures that the algorithm meets the operational constraints of the routing problem.  

## Configuration Parameters Structure  

Each Configuration Parameter consists of:

### Explanation

This setup configures an optimization with the following characteristics:

* **"Test Optimization" as the instance name** – Identifies the optimization session.
* **Time windows are respected** (`ignoreTimeWindow = false`) – Ensures that orders are scheduled within their specified delivery windows.
* **Orders can be dropped if needed** (`allowDroppingOrders = true`) – Allows the algorithm to exclude unserviceable orders.
* **No grouping of nearby orders** (`groupingOrders = false`) – Each order is treated individually regardless of proximity.
* **No route balancing applied** (`balancedRoutes = None (0)`) – The algorithm does not attempt to balance workloads across routes.
* **Optimization is based on travel distance** (`optimizationCriterion = Distance (1)`) – The algorithm prioritizes routes with shorter total distance.
* **Arrangement is done using matrix-based distance** (`arrangeCriterion = Matrix (0)`) – Orders are arranged based on distance matrix calculations.
* **Optimized solution quality is targeted** (`optimizationQuality = Optimized (2)`) – Provides a well-refined solution without exhaustive search.
* **Maximum optimization time is limited to 600 seconds** (`maxTimeToOptimize = 600`) – Constrains algorithm runtime for performance.
* **Vehicles can wait up to 5 hours at an order** (`maxWaitTime = 18000`) – Allows schedule alignment with time windows.
* **Each route is circular** (`routeType = RoundRoute (0)`) – Routes start and end at the same location.
* **No road restrictions applied** (`restrictions = None (0)`) – All roads, including tolls and highways, are considered.
* **Distance is measured in kilometers** (`distanceUnit = Kilometers (0)`) – Units used in optimization calculations.
* **No specific order sequence constraints** (`orderSequenceOptions = []`) – Orders can be visited in any sequence.
